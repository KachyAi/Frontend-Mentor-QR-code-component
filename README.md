### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
body { font-family: "https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit"; display: flex;
justify-content: center; align-items: center; flex-direction: column; height:
100vh; background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%); overflow: hidden; }
<!-- now this is some Really nice way to centre a div, Overflow:hidden not advived though -->
```
